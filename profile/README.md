* The [UAB Biological Data Science Core (U-BDS)](https://www.uab.edu/cores/ircp/bds) is an institutional resource which aims to provide services, foster long-term collaborations with the UAB research community, and provide training for biomedical investigators on a specific set of analysis tools and techniques.
* The services we offer are [listed here](https://www.uab.edu/cores/ircp/bds-services).
* Our training website is available [here](https://u-bds.github.io/training_guides/).
* Our enquiry form is available [here](https://www.wrike.com/frontend/requestforms/index.html?token=eyJhY2NvdW50SWQiOjQ2ODk3ODQsInRhc2tGb3JtSWQiOjUxMTIyNn0JNDc3OTg5MTE1NzQxNwlkNDgyOTg3Zjc0N2YyYmE4YWE3YThiYjVmNjQ3NzM1MzYyMTM5ZDlmN2I4NTU2NWZkZDZiMWY4MDg4MTJmYzI2).

## Other resources:

* We provide bi to tri-annual workshops which cover the fundamentals of programming (R, Python, Unix, git) with current plans to provide data analysis workshops. Please contact us for further information.
* We are active members of the nf-core community. As part of this community, we provide the following support:
  * Aid across a variety of nf-core pipelines in [our weekly office hours](https://www.uab.edu/cores/ircp/bds-training-and-outreach).
  * We are the maintainers of the [Cheaha profile](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/docs/cheaha.md) (to enable executor mode).
  * Some of the members from U-BDS are also the developers of the `nf-core/scnanoseq` pipeline. The main home for this pipeline can be found at the [nf-core scnanoseq repository](https://github.com/nf-core/scnanoseq) rather than U-BDS.
